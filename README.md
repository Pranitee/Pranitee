## Hi I'm PraniteeðŸ‘‹

 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring web development, app development, and innovative tech projects.
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced programming in Java and mobile application development.
 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting coding projects, open-source contributions, and new tech ideas.

 âš¡I can easily lose track of time when Iâ€™m coding or sketching. Debugging or adding the final touches to a drawing is my kind of therapy!
